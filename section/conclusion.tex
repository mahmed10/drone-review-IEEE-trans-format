\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusionsection}
\textcolor{red}{
In this article, we have presented the latest engineering developments in drone technology and their applications. We have thoroughly investigated the the recent research directions on the network, localization and data management frameworks for drones, especially focusing on the autonomous navigation, safety, signal processing aspects. We then summarized recent trends in application of drones in infrastructure monitoring, object tracking, disaster management, rescue system and supply chain management scenarios.

% We have thoroughly summarized the few recent research work for drone applications, such as autonomous system design, collision avoidance, infrastructure monitoring, object tracking, disaster management, rescue system, data augmentation and compression technique, etc. 
In addition, we have discussed a few benchmark dataset that has been collected by drone and mentioned toolkits that can be used as a data collector. 
Current drone-related research concepts present \textcolor{red}{plethora} of options for pre-processing, post-processing, autonomous operation, analysis, and visual representation with a minimal physical workflow. 
Nonetheless, a lot of issues in this area remain unexplored, 
\textcolor{red}{especially regarding the maintaining the privacy and security of users.}
  Therefore, our belief is that the opportunities and challenges highlighted in this survey would help upcoming researchers, who are aiming to improve drone applications.
