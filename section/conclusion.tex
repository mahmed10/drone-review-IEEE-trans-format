\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusionsection}
We have presented the latest engineering developments in drone applications throughout the survey. We have thoroughly summarized the few recent research work for drone applications, such as autonomous system design, collision avoidance, infrastructure monitoring, object tracking, disaster management, rescue system, data augmentation and compression technique, etc. In addition, we have discussed a few benchmark dataset that has been collected by drone and mentioned toolkits that can be used as a data collector. Current drone-related research concepts present a range of options for pre-processing, post-processing, autonomous operation, analysis, and visual representation with a minimal physical workflow. Nonetheless, a lot of issues in this area remain unexplored. Therefore, our belief is that the opportunities and challenges highlighted in this survey would help upcoming researchers, who are aiming to improve drone applications.
